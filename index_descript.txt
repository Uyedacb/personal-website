<p>Hi, I am an Informatics
  student at the University of Washington. I love working on projects that push my knowledge.
  During my free time I enjoy working on independent projects that push my knowledge and
  as I continue to develop my skills, In the past few years I have developed
  a skillset that includes: programming experience in Java, experience creating
  embedded electronics, and web design through this personal website.
  I hope to use the collective experience I've gained to engineer cost efficient solutions to
  health issues in developing countries. This website details some of my passion projects
  and other interests.
  Feel free to contact me!
