        <p class="body-text">Hi, I am a electronics enthuisiast and a third year Informatics
          major at the University of Washington.
          During my free time I enjoy working on independent projects that push my knowledge and
          as I continue to develop my skills, In the past few years I have developed
          a skillset that includes: programming experience in Java, experience creating
          embedded electronics, and web design through this personal website.
          I hope to use the collective experience I've gained to engineer cost efficient solutions to
          health issues in developing countries. This website details some of my passion projects
          and other interests.
          Feel free to contact me about just anything you feel like!</p>
